# This resource allows you to define and manage AWS Lambda functions using Terraform. It supports specifying various attributes such as:

# function_name: The name of the Lambda function.
# filename: The path to the deployment package (ZIP file).
# handler: The function within your code that Lambda calls to begin execution.
# runtime: The runtime environment for the Lambda function (e.g., python3.12).
# role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Lambda assumes when it executes your function.
# source_code_hash: A base64-encoded SHA256 hash of the deployment package. Terraform uses this to determine when to update the function.
